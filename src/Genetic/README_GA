FDP_GA...  -  Genetic test suite prioritization based on the GELATIONS system
by Conrad et al.

FDP_GA : Main prioritization function, single run.
	Produces a list with an ordering and fitness score
	See CS09-01 p.11

::Parameters:
	FaultMatrix :: Fault matrix in memory as produced by the KFDM
	TestCosts :: Vector of test costs with length equal to number of tests
	cPopSize :: (Integer) size of the population in each iteration
	cMutRate :: Mutation Rate of the Population [0:1]
	cChildDens :: percentage of population which results from crossover
	TransOp :: Transformation operator, see FDP_TransOps
	SelOp :: Selection operator, see FDP_SelOp
	CrossOp :: Crossover operator, see FDP_CrossOps
	MutOp :: Mutation Operator, see FDP_MutOps
	RandomSeed :: Random seed value 
	TermCond :: Termination Condition, see FDP_Termination
	TermConds :: Specify the value corresponding to the TermCond of the run

FDP_Exp_GA : Multiple runs of a single FDP_GA configuration
	Produces a date frame 
	fileFaultMatrix and fileTestCosts consume file locations
	Trials corresponds the number runs of the GA configuration
	All other parametere are as in FDP_GA
